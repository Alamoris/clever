# Assembling and setting up a mechanical gripper

1. Join the main gripper plates.

2. Place the servo in the corresponding groove in the center of the plates, with the gear in the middle of the grip.

3. Press down on the pick plates with small spacers.

4. Install the gripper plate so that the mounting holes in the gripper line up with the self-tapping holes in the plate.

5. Secure the gripper with self-tapping screws.

6. Turn the servo gear to the end position.

7. Install the cruciform mount onto the gear.

8. Secure the cruciform mount with the screw that comes with the servo.

9. Tie the servo fibre so that there is 2 to 3 cm of headroom.

10. Slide the servo fibre into the appropriate tensioning grooves.

11. Anchor the gripper claws with small self-tapping screws so that their angle is 25°-40°.

12. Install the assembled grip onto the drone from below.

13. Route the servo cable and insert it into the *AUX* 1-2 output on the flight controller.

14. In order to configure control of grip from the remote control, go to the *Radio* tab.

15. In the *AUX 1/2 Passthrough RC channel* parameter, select the desired channel.

16. Now, when you toggle the toggle switch of the corresponding channel, the capture will be opened or closed, respectively.
